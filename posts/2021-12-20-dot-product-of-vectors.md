When I was learning about vectors in my highschool's calculus course, we briefly touched on the dot product. We spent a day or two learning about the formulas: \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = \\| \vec{a} \\|  \\| \vec{v} \\| \cos (\\theta) \\) and \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = a\_1b\_1 + a\_2b\_2 + a\_3b\_3 + ... +a\_nb\_n = \\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(a\_ib\_i) \\). The first involves the magnitudes of the vectors and the angle between them. The second involves uses the component of each vector. 

Needless to say, I memorized these formulas without a clear understanding of how they came to be until a year later. I have written a small write up to satisfy my own curiosity and hope this may be of help to anyone else.
