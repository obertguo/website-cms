# Definition and Notation

## Recall Reimann Sums

\[
A = \lim\_{n \to \infty} \sum\_{i=1}^{n} f(x_{i}^{*}) \Delta{x}
\]

This definition came with restrictions that \(f(x)\) required to be continuous and nonnegative. Releasing these constraints help to yield a definite integral.

If \(f(x)\) is defined on an interval \([a,b]\), the **definite integral** of f from a to b is given by:

\[
\int\_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = \lim\_{n \to \infty} \sum\_{i=1}^{n} f(x\_{i}^{*}) \Delta{x}
\]

provided the limit exists. If the limit exists, the function \(f(x)\) is said to be integrable on \(\[a,b]\) or is an **integrable function.**
